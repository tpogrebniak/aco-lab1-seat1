# CCDM Demo Store

This demo store was built for a Adobe Summit 2025 Lab. It was originally cloned off the https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce repo and had modifications made, including:

* A custom version of the PLP widget
* A custom version of the LS Widget
* A custom header specific to the lab scenario/data
* Custom configuration specific to the lab scenario/data

You can use this template yourself by using the CLI: https://github.com/adobe-commerce/aio-cli-plugin-commerce

Select `ccdm-demo-store` and `demo tenant` when the options present themselves.

Note: This is not a supported storefront/product. It probably has bugs. You are on your own if you start from this template.
